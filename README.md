To use the app, users can either upload a file by clicking on the "Choose a Data File" button, which supports multiple formats such as CSV, TXT, TSV, Excel, JSON, and RDF, or select one of the built-in datasets, such as "mtcars" or "iris", from the dropdown menu. Once a file is uploaded or a dataset is selected, the app will display a preview of the first 10 rows of the dataset in a table format.
