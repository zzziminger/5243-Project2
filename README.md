To use the app, users can either upload a file by clicking on the "Choose a Data File" button, which supports multiple formats such as CSV, TXT, TSV, Excel, JSON, and RDF, or select one of the built-in datasets, such as "mtcars" or "iris", from the dropdown menu. Once a file is uploaded or a dataset is selected, the app will display a preview of the first 10 rows of the dataset in a table format. (The maximum file size for uploads is 100MB)

Data cleaning: This section of the R Shiny app handles data cleaning and preprocessing by allowing users to upload datasets in various formats or select built-in ones. The cleaning process includes removing duplicate rows, imputing missing values (median for numeric variables and mode for categorical ones), standardizing column names, encoding categorical variables as factors, and scaling numerical features. An interactive interface enables users to preview both raw and cleaned data dynamically, ensuring consistency and readiness for further analysis.
